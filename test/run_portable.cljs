;; The portable suite on a SECOND runtime (nbb / SCI).
;;
;; `clojure -M:test` on the JVM is the primary suite and this does not replace
;; it. What it adds is the class of defect only a second runtime can see:
;; portable `.cljc` that is correct under Clojure and quietly wrong, or
;; unloadable, under ClojureScript. Every source file here is `.cljc`, and
;; until 2026-08-25 there was no ClojureScript runner in this repository, so
;; that claim had never been executed (root ADR-2608730000).
;;
;; The sibling repository `kotoba-lang/si` carries much of the same code and
;; got its runner on 2026-08-17; this is the same step here.
;;
;; Anything added to `test/` as `.cljc` belongs in BOTH lists below; being
;; required is not being run. `scripts/verify-cljs-runner-completeness.cljs`
;; in the superproject checks this file against the tree.
