  "What the ClojureScript mirror of the constants map may and may not carry.

  `signal-integrity.constants/constants` is read from an EDN resource on the JVM and
  inlined as a literal map on ClojureScript. Three of its values --
  `:eye/lcg-seed`, `:eye/lcg-multiplier`, `:eye/lcg-increment` -- need more
  than 53 bits, which is more than a ClojureScript number has. Written into
  the mirror they were silently rounded: 6364136223846793005 became
  6364136223846793000. Measured 2026-08-25.

  Nothing on that runtime read them -- `eye-diagram/next-rand` runs a 32-bit
  xorshift there and every `def` touching these keys is `#?(:clj ...)` -- so
  the rounding was harmless the day it was written. It was harmless the way an
  unexploded charge is: the first ClojureScript caller to ask for the
  multiplier would have got a number that is not the multiplier, and nothing
  would have said so.

  They are now absent from the mirror instead, so such a caller gets `nil`.
  These tests are what keeps that a decision rather than an accident."
