(ns signal-integrity.constants
  "Physical and empirical constants for the `signal-integrity.*`
  signal-integrity formulas, extracted from kami-si's (retired Rust
  crate, kotoba-lang/kami-engine, ADR-2607010000) `const` definitions
  and inline magic numbers into pure EDN data
  (`resources/signal_integrity/constants.edn`).

  No network, no I/O in the domain sense: on the JVM the bundled classpath
  resource is read once at namespace load (a local, offline read of data
  shipped inside the library jar — not runtime I/O against the network or
  filesystem outside the artifact). cljs has no `clojure.java.io`/`slurp`,
  so it inlines an equivalent literal map instead of reading the resource.

  `constants.edn` is stored as a single-entity Datomic/Datascript tx-data
  vector (`[{:db/id -1 ...}]`) so it can be handed directly to
  `(d/transact conn (edn/read-string (slurp f)))`; the JVM branch strips
  that wrapper (`dissoc :db/id`) to recover the original flat map."
